# CloudTier-Storage-Tiering-SDK
The CloudTier Storage Tiering SDK is a Hierarchical Storage Management (HSM) file system filter driver development kit. It is a data storage technique that automatically moves data between high-cost and low-cost storage media. It allows you to free up on-premise storage capacity transparently,by moving out cooler data to the cloud storage, thereby reducing capital and operational expenditures.

The CloudTier Storage Tiering SDK provides you a simple and low-cost solution to integrate your on-premise storage to cloud storage infrastructure in a seamless, secure, and transparent fashion. There is no interruption to migrate your on-premise files to the remote cloud storage, so you don't need to change your existing applications and infrastructure. It uses the on-premises storage as a tier 0 storage (hot storage), uses the public cloud storage as a tier 1 storage (clod storage). So you can connect the cloud storage as a second tier. Your application can use the cloud storage just like the local storage without any changes.
